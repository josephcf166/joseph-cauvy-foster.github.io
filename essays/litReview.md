The literature review explores the multifaceted nature of parkour, including its culture, benefits, and the specific niche that the ParkourSpotter app aims to fill. It highlights parkour's classification as a sport and lifestyle, emphasizing its non-competitive, inclusive ethos that contrasts with traditional sports' focus on competition and marginalization. The review addresses the absence of a dedicated platform for parkour enthusiasts to share and discover spots, emphasizing the community's need for a specialized app. It discusses existing platforms' limitations and the potential of ParkourSpotter to foster community and inclusion among practitioners by leveraging user-generated content and ratings. The review also delves into the technical aspect of the app's route finding feature, comparing it to the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Orienteering Problem, ultimately favoring the latter for its relevance to the project's goals.
